                        Everything you made me happy like no one haha to me it seems crazy to even think about it, the
                        fact that meeting someone via instagram would turn out so well. <br>
                        Today I went to visit the place that I would hide if the zombie apocalipse strikes remember I told you?
                        hahahah I did think about you when I has there and the truth is after all I just hope you're
                        doing fine and not just fine but better. <br>
                        Once again thank you queen you deserve all the good
                        things that happen to you and also to your family I hope they achieve all of their goals this
                        new year that comes :).<br>
                        again thank you I hope you the best as the woderfull person that you are
                        to me
